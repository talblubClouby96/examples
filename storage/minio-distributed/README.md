## Introduction
Minio is an AWS S3 compatible, object storage server built for cloud applications and devops. Minio is _cloud native_, meaning Minio understands that it
is running within a cluster manager, and uses the cluster management infrastructure for allocation of compute and storage resources.

The following document describes the process to deploy [distributed Minio](https://docs.minio.io/docs/distributed-minio-quickstart-guide) server on Kubernetes.
This example uses the [official Minio Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/~/dockerfile/) from Docker Hub.

This example uses some of the core components of Kubernetes:

- [_Pods_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/)
- [_Services_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/)
- [_Statefulsets_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/)

## Prerequisites

This example assumes that you have a Kubernetes version >=1.5 cluster installed and running, and that you have installed the [`kubectl`](../../../docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl.md)
command line tool somewhere in your path.  Please see the
[getting started guides](../../../docs/getting-started-guides/)
for installation instructions for your platform.

## Quickstart

Run the below commands to get started quickly

```sh
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/examples/storage/minio-distributed/minio-distributed-headless-service.yaml?raw=true
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/examples/storage/minio-distributed/minio-distributed-statefulset.yaml?raw=true
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/examples/storage/minio-distributed/minio-distributed-service.yaml?raw=true
```

## Step 1: Create Minio Headless Service

Headless Service controls the domain within which we create StatefulSets. The domain managed by this Service takes the form: `$(service name).$(namespace).svc.cluster.local` (where “cluster.local” is the cluster domain), and the pods in this domain take the form: `$(pod-name-{i}).$(service name).$(namespace).svc.cluster.local`. This is required to get a DNS resolvable URL for each of the pods created within the Statefulset.

This is the Headless service description.

```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: minio
  labels:
    app: minio
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
    - port: 9000
      name: minio
  selector:
    app: minio
```

Create the Headless Service

```sh
kubectl create -f minio-distributed-headless-service.yaml
```
The response should be like this:

```sh
service "minio" created
```

# Step 2: Create Minio Statefulset

A StatefulSet provides a deterministic name and a unique identity to each pod, making it easy to deploy stateful distributed applications. To launch distributed Minio you need to pass drive locations as parameters to the minio server command. Then, you’ll need to run the same command on all the participating pods. StatefulSets offer a perfect way to handle this requirement.

This is the Statefulset description.

```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: minio
spec:
  serviceName: "minio"
  replicas: 4
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/initialized: "true"
      labels:
        app: minio
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: minio
        env:
        - name: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY
          value: "minio"
        - name: MINIO_SECRET_KEY
          value: "minio123"
        image: minio/minio
        command: ["minio"]
        args: ["server", "http://minio-0.minio.default.svc.cluster.local/data", "http://minio-1.minio.default.svc.cluster.local/data", "http://minio-2.minio.default.svc.cluster.local/data", "http://minio-3.minio.default.svc.cluster.local/data"]
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9000
          hostPort: 9000
        # These volume mounts are persistent. Each pod in the PetSet
        # gets a volume mounted based on this field.
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /data
  # These are converted to volume claims by the controller
  # and mounted at the paths mentioned above.
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: data
      annotations:
        volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class: anything
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
```

[Download example] (minio-distributed-statefulset.yaml?raw=true)

Create the Statefulset

```sh
kubectl create -f minio-distributed-statefulset.yaml
```

The response should be like this

```sh
statefulset "minio" created
```

# Step 3: Create Minio Service

Now that you have a Minio statefulset running, you may either want to access it internally (within the cluster) or expose it as a Service onto an external (outside of your cluster, maybe public internet) IP address, depending on your use case. You can achieve this using Services. There are 3 major service types — default type is ClusterIP, which exposes a service to connection from inside the cluster. NodePort and LoadBalancer are two types that expose services to external traffic.

In this example, we expose the Minio Deployment by creating a LoadBalancer service. This is the service description.

```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: minio-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 9000
      targetPort: 9000
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: minio-server
```

[Download example] (minio-distributed-service.yaml?raw=true)

```sh
kubectl create -f minio-distributed-service.yaml
```

The response should be like this

```sh
service "minio-service" created
```
To check if the service was created successfully, run the command

```sh
kubectl get svc minio-service
```

You should get a response like this
```sh
NAME            CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)          AGE
minio-service   10.55.248.23   104.199.249.165   9000:31852/TCP   1m
```

# Step 4: Resource cleanup

Once you are done, cleanup the cluster using
```sh
kubectl delete statefulset minio \
&&  kubectl delete svc minio \
&& kubectl delete svc minio-service
```
